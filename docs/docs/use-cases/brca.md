# Cancers with Pathogenic BRCA Mutations

From the PCAWG study, we retrieved 44 whole genomes of cancer samples with bi-allelic loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. We followed the previously published curation of germline and somatic mutations in these two genes[^1]. 

The visualization shows that while both display general chromosomal instability, BRCA1 cancers show the predominance of tandem duplications, while deletions dominate BRCA2 cancers. Additionally, the telomeric loss-of-heterozygosity segments characteristic of homologous recombination deficiency, often appear to be delineated by unbalanced translocations ([example](https://chromoscope.bio/?demoIndex=9&domain=1683276173.7073574-1699032388.9649158&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/pathogenicBrca/configs/pathogenicBrca.all.config.json)).
